    """
    Extract all n-grams from a sequence

    An n-gram is a contiguous sub-sequence within `seq` of length `n`. This
    function extracts them (in order) from `seq`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    seq : sequence
        A sequence of words or token ids representing a transcription.
    n : int
        The size of sub-sequence to extract.

    Calculate the precision for a given order of n-gram

    Parameters
    ----------
    reference : sequence
        The reference transcription. A sequence of words or token ids.
    candidate : sequence
        The candidate transcription. A sequence of words or token ids
        (whichever is used by `reference`)
    n : int

    Calculate the BLEU score.  Please scale the BLEU score by 100.0
    In the case that the candidate has length less than n, p_n is 0.

    Parameters
    ----------
    reference : sequence
        The reference transcription. A sequence of words or token ids.
    candidate : sequence
        The candidate transcription. A sequence of words or token ids
